                    Soak rice and dal separately for 30 minutes, then pressure cook for 5 whistles on medium flame, along with tamarind for easy juice extraction. Mash the cooked ingredients and extract tamarind juice with ¾ cup water. Peel and cube potatoes and carrots, and boil with mochai (field beans) until nearly cooked. Fry cashew nuts in ghee until golden, then roast red chilli, coriander seeds, urad dal, chana dal, asafoetida, cinnamon, clove, marathi moggu, cumin seeds, and coconut in the same pan until golden. Grind the roasted spices into a fine powder. Fry small onions in ghee until transparent and add to the boiled veggies. Pour in tamarind extract, turmeric, salt, and jaggery, then add the powdered spices and bring to a boil. Stir in the cooked rice and dal mixture, and cook on medium flame to avoid sticking or burning. Once heated through, add fried cashews and switch off the flame.

In a kadai, heat oil and temper with the items listed under ‘to temper’ in order. Add garlic and roughly chopped onion, frying until transparent. Then add tomatoes and fry until soft.

                    Chop the vegetables into fine cubes and finely chop the onions and tomatoes. Grind the ingredients under "To grind" to a smooth paste. Heat oil in a small pressure cooker or pan and add the tempering items under "to temper". Once the cumin splutters, add curry leaves, then onions, and fry for a minute. Add the ginger garlic paste and fry on low flame until the raw smell disappears. Add tomatoes and salt, and fry. Then, add red chilli powder, garam masala powder, and turmeric powder, and fry until mushy. Add the ground paste and fry on low flame until the raw smell goes away (about 3-4 minutes). Add the chopped vegetables, except cauliflower. Mix well with a cup of water and check for salt. Bring to a boil, then add cauliflower (kept immersed in hot water with turmeric). Mix well, close the lid, and pressure cook for one whistle on medium flame. Open and add coriander leaves. You can either add coriander leaves in the previous step and pressure cook, or add them at the end, as per your preference.

                    To the pan, add olive oil, onion, and bell pepper, and sauté until softened. Add garlic, cook for a minute, then remove the veggies from the pan. Add a little more oil, along with diced chicken, season with salt and pepper, and cook until about 50% done. Remove to a plate. Add rice to the pan and toast for about 3 minutes. Stir in broth and paella spices, then return chicken and veggies to the pan. At this stage, add tomatoes and some water. Let the paella simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the rice is tender. Finally, stir in peas and fresh parsley, and cook just until warmed through.

Add salt, cumin seeds, asafoetida, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, coriander cumin powder, white sesame seeds, kasuri methi powder, oil, and ghee, and mix everything by hand. Knead the dough into a fist, then add water as required to make a stiff dough. Cover with a cloth and let it rest for 15 minutes. Knead the dough again for 1 minute, then cut it with a knife or fork spoon. Heat an iron tawa, add ghee, and roast bhakris on a low flame, applying ghee on both sides. Press the bhakri with a wooden stick while roasting to ensure it's properly cooked from all sides, making our crispy methi masala bhakhri. Roast all the bhakris this way to prepare them.
